# cats-fruitpicking
A simple ESX script to create targets to pick fruit from. Comes with a cooldown for realistic, limited fruit supply. 

Dependancies:
es_extended
Ox_inventory
Ox_target
Ox_lib

This file will include optional starter fruits that I've already preconfigured, but it will work for any item you want to create a target zone for.
